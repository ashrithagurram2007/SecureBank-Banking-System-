# 🏦 SecureBank - Console Based Banking System (Java OOP Case Study)

## 📌 Overview
**SecureBank** is a console-based **Bank Account Management System** developed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java**.  
It allows users to create and manage **Savings** and **Checking** accounts while supporting core banking operations such as **deposit**, **withdraw**, and **balance inquiry**.

This project demonstrates the use of **Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Method Overriding, Constructors, Access Modifiers, and Custom Exceptions**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
SecureBank is a small regional bank that wants to digitize its basic banking system.  
The bank requires a system that can:

- Create new customer accounts (Savings / Checking)
- Store customer details (Account Number, Holder Name, Balance, Account Type)
- Perform secure transactions:
  - **Deposit** funds
  - **Withdraw** funds with validation (no overdrafts allowed)
- Display account balance and transaction status messages
- Demonstrate **inheritance & polymorphism** through account types

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Implemented

| Concept | Usage in Project |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Class & Object** | Represent Bank Accounts and operations |
| **Constructors** | Initialize new account objects |
| **Inheritance** | SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount extend Base Account class |
| **Method Overriding** | Different withdrawal/interest logic for each account type |
| **Encapsulation** | Private data members with controlled access |
| **Polymorphism** | Same method name performing different behaviors |
| **Exception Handling** | Handles insufficient balance errors |
